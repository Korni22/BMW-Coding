# Requirements

## Preable

Right now, this repository is mostly for F- and G- series BMWs, since these are the only cars I have experience with.
Also, some options mentioned will differ from series to series, so we'll have to collect a few different options and things for different series of cars to make every option work.

The mentioned applications are copyrighted and for-profit software, I'd love for someone to point me towards a open source alternative - should such a thing exist.

## Hardware

1. A F- or G-series BMW
2. A Computer (preferrably a notebook for obvious reasons) with Windows as its operating system with an ethernet jack
3. An ENET cable

Although not required by definition, it is very much recommended you get a charger for your car's battery, as you definitely want the voltage to be stable in case something takes longer than expected!

## Software

1. Windows
2. E-SYS
3. E-SYS Launcher
4. BMW PSdZdata

Once you have assembled all the requirements, you can go ahead and connect to your vehicle.
